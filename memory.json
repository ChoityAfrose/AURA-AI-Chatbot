        "message": "### What is OOP?\n\nOOP stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**. It's a way of organizing and writing computer programs.\n\n### The Main Idea\n\n*   Imagine real-world objects around you, like a car, a dog, or a phone.\n*   OOP tries to model these real-world objects in your computer code.\n*   Each \"object\" in your code can have its own data (what it is) and behaviors (what it can do).\n\n### Why Use OOP?\n\n*   **Organized Code:** It helps keep your code neat and easy to understand, especially for big projects.\n*   **Reusable Code:** You can create \"blueprints\" (called **Classes**) for objects and then easily make many similar objects from that blueprint.\n*   **Easier to Manage:** If something goes wrong with one \"object,\" it's often easier to fix it without affecting other parts of your program.\n\n### Simple Example\n\nLet's think about a `Car`:\n\n*   A `Car` is a **Class** (the blueprint). It defines what all cars have in common (color, speed, ability to drive).\n*   Your specific red Honda, or a blue Toyota, are **Objects** created from the `Car` blueprint.\n    *   The red Honda object has `color = \"red\"` and can `drive()`.\n    *   The blue Toyota object has `color = \"blue\"` and can `drive()`.\n\nEach object is a self-contained unit with its own details and actions."

        "message": "### What is Inheritance?\n\nInheritance is a key concept in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It allows one class to \"inherit\" properties and behaviors from another class.\n\n### The Main Idea\n\n*   Think of it like real-world family inheritance. A child often inherits traits (like eye color or hair color) from their parents.\n*   In programming, a \"child\" class (called a **subclass** or **derived class**) can get all the features (data and actions) of a \"parent\" class (called a **superclass** or **base class**).\n*   The child class can then add its own unique features or change inherited ones.\n\n### Why Use Inheritance?\n\n*   **Code Reusability:** You don't have to write the same code over and over again. If several classes share common features, you can put those features in a parent class and have others inherit them.\n*   **Easier Maintenance:** If you need to change a common feature, you only have to change it in one place (the parent class), and all child classes will get the update automatically.\n*   **Organized Code:** It helps create a clear hierarchy and structure for your program.\n\n### Simple Example\n\nLet's use our `Car` example from before:\n\n#### Parent Class (Superclass)\n*   Imagine a general `Vehicle` class.\n*   A `Vehicle` has properties like `speed`, `color`, and can `drive()`.\n\n#### Child Class (Subclass)\n*   Now, a `Car` class can **inherit** from the `Vehicle` class.\n*   This means a `Car` automatically gets `speed`, `color`, and the `drive()` action from `Vehicle`.\n*   A `Car` might then add its own unique features, like `numberOfDoors` or a `honk()` action, that a `Bicycle` (another `Vehicle`) wouldn't have.\n\nSo, `Car` is a type of `Vehicle`, inheriting common traits while adding its own specifics."
